# Blockchain: As a revolution in health care

### What is Blockchain and how can it revolutionize health care? 

The promise of blockchain has widespread implications for stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. Capitalizing on this technology has the potential to connect fragmented systems to generate insights and to better assess the value of care. In the long term, a nationwide blockchain network for electronic medical records may improve efficiencies and support better health outcomes for patients.

##### What is Blockchain?
A Blockchain, originally block chain, is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. The Harvard Business Review describes it as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way." Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high consensus has therefore been achieved with a Blockchain. This makes Blockchains potentially suitable for the recording of events, medical records, and other records management activities, such as identity management, transaction processing, documenting provenance, food traceability or voting. 

##### Advantages of Blockchain
**Increased data integrity and provenance:** Blockchain transactions are immutable. Once conducted, a blockchain transaction cannot be deleted or altered. Transactions are securely recorded on the network and can be shared across the network. This helps in proof of data integrity, any user can verify the data time-stamp without a third party or altering it. Once a transaction has been conducted on the blockchain network its original author is indicated and the transaction remains atomic for the entire life of the blockchain.

**Security:** Before a transaction is recorded on the blockchain network it must first be verified by other blockchain users. After verification, the transaction is cryptographically encrypted and linked to a previous transaction. Additionally, data is stored across a network of devices hence it’s virtually impossible to hack. Overall, blockchain offers unrivalled security for systems and data.

**Transparency:** All participants in a blockchain network share the same documentation, hence everyone must agree before an existing version is changed. To change a single transaction on a blockchain network it would require an overhaul of the whole network, hence the data on the network is largely accurate, consistent and transparent. Because of the decentralized nature of the blockchain, all participants can access any transactions provided as long as they have a private key. This allows easier sharing of information across multiple platforms.

### Blockchain in health care

There is numerous health care Blockchain application which includes;

#### RECORD KEEPING
**Medical treatment history tracking**
With Blockchain patient’s medical treatment can be tracked anywhere and anytime with no ambiguity and hence giving the health practitioners a better understanding of the patient.
_Data Security: Speaking of security, did you know that your medical data is worth more on the black market than your credit card number? According to Protenus Breach Barometer report, 140 million patient records were hacked between 2015 and 2016._
>**The blockchain has the potential to keep your private information safe and secure while still being able to connect it everywhere**

**Medical devices usage history tracking**
The use of  medical devices such as electronic wearables have now been on the increase, analysis shows that there’s a 40% percent chance that medical patients uses a medical device to track their health status, but this becomes a problem making it difficulty to store all those daily medical reports from the device for the patients, but with blockchain all this records can be safely stored.

**Drug supply chain tracking**
Statistics from the Hudson River Field Office (HRFO) indicate that over 15% of drugs sold in developing countries are counterfeit. Reports further suggest that pharmaceutical companies lose about $200 billion annually due to counterfeiting. Blockchain can, with its proof of authenticity features and point-by-point tracking possibilities, curb this trend by ensuring that once a drug is produced that it is genuine and therefore users can verify the authenticity of the drugs before purchasing them.

#### DIGITAL IDENTITY

**Patient identity validation**
Blockchain can solve the issue of patients’ identity theft and will reduced the use of fake ID’s by impersonators to buy drugs for drug abuse purposes or any bad reason.

**Health care providers identity validation**
Although this might sound usual but impersonation by fake medical personal is more common in third world countries and have caused great number of deaths, but with blockchain these issues can be address with its validation system.

**Drug identity validation**
Drug identity can be validated using the blockchain technology. By providing information about the drug thereby reducing fake drugs into circulation.

#### FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

**Direct health care service payment**
Blockchain technology have indeed proofed the it is a great platform for financial transactions through the use of bitcoin and this model can also be applied into health care.

**Health care regime gratification**

#### SMART CONTRACT

**Health care data backed research/treatment**
Coordinating clinical trials and research and development activities have been even more challenging since there are several institutions involved. This has been made even more difficult due to dishonesty and theft of intellectual property. Blockchain can change this by allowing users to authenticate any document and ensuring proof of existence. Researchers can, therefore, share statistics, test results and quality reports without fear of intellectual property theft.

#### Implementation challenges and considerations

Blockchain technology presents numerous opportunities for health care; however, it is not fully mature today nor a panacea that can be immediately applied. Several technical, organizational, and behavioral economics challenges must be addressed before a health care blockchain can be adopted by organizations nationwide.
